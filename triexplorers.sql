The wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing with/through caravans or sea-voyagers, end-user retailing often demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from village to hamlet, gyrovagues (wandering monks) and wandering friars brought theology and pastoral support to neglected areas, traveling minstrels toured, and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and in sundry other wars.[8] Pilgrimages were common in both the European and Islamic world and involved streams of travelers both locally and internationally.[10]\r\n\r\nIn the late 16th century, it became fashionable for young European aristocrats and wealthy upper-class men to travel to significant European cities as part of their education in the arts and literature. This was known as the Grand Tour, and included cities such as London, Paris, Venice, Florence, and Rome. However, the French Revolution brought with it the end of the Grand Tour.[8]\r\n\r\nTravel by water often provided more comfort and speed than land-travel, at least until the advent of a network of railways in the 19th century. Travel for the purpose of tourism is reported to have started around this time when people began to travel for fun as travel was no longer a hard and challenging task. This was capitalized on by people like Thomas Cook selling tourism packages where trains and hotels were booked together.[11] Airships and airplanes took over much of the role of long-distance surface travel in the 20th century, notably after the Second World War where there was a surplus of both aircraft and pilots.[8] Air travel has become so ubiquitous in the 21st century that one woman, Alexis Alford, visited all 196 countries before the age of 21.[12]', 'g1.jpg', '2022-12-17 17:41:02'),
(3, 'third post', 'travel passion', 'third', 'ather than writing about a recent vacation, I‚Äôve decided to write about why I travel and how I‚Äôve grown from my experiences. I hope this answers questions and inspires those that are sitting where I was just a few years ago.\r\n\r\nAfter living in a rustic, small town for the past 18 years, I was craving change and adventure. Four years later, a senior at UNC Charlotte, I‚Äôve traveled to more places during college than the first two decades of my life.\r\n\r\nTraveling has not only been something that I do, but it has been something that has become a part of me. I have this passion to travel. I haven‚Äôt been across the globe or to every continent; but, I‚Äôve had my share of travel and it‚Äôs only the beginning. When I get stuck on a consistent routine, I get an itch to pack up my bags and go somewhere spontaneous. Whether it‚Äôs by car or plane, there isn‚Äôt anything more exciting than traveling to make new experiences and memories that will last forever.\r\n\r\nThere are countless reasons why I am passionate about traveling:\r\n\r\nThe People\r\n\r\nMeeting people from all over the world is the most rewarding part about traveling. The conversations will build knowledge and may lead to bigger opportunities. Networking is becoming a powerful tool and communication is valuable for travelers craving new experiences.\r\n\r\nThe Food\r\n\r\n\r\nChef‚Äôs seafood special from Fleet Landing Restaurant and Bar located in Charleston, SC.\r\nThe taste of an authentic dish from a different part of the world is both scary and exhilarating. For me, I enjoy tasting unique foods and some of the best meals I‚Äôve had have been from places I typically would not consider.\r\n\r\nThe Exposure\r\n\r\nExposure to new environments is fulfilling and educational. Traveling takes me out of my comfort zone and it allows me to communicate to natives with different religious beliefs, cultures and ethnicities.\r\n\r\nThe Beauty\r\n\r\n\r\nThe picturesque landscapes enhance every travelers experience. I enjoy taking photos and when I travel, I try to capture the natural beauty of the place I am visiting. I like sharing my photos to help bring my story to life and after getting the perfect shot, I quickly turn to my notebook to check another breathtaking site off my bucket list.\r\n\r\nThe Chance To Build Character', '', '2022-12-20 17:34:27');
